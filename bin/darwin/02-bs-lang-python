# This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
# because macOS provides an older sqlite3.

# If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
#   echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/sqlite/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
# 
# For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
#     LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/sqlite/lib
#     CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/sqlite/include
