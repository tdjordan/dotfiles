* All the Breakages
  Since Neorg is still very new there are a lot of expected breaking changes.
  We're really sorry about their existence as we know that having to change stuff is annoying -
  having too frequent breaking changes almost makes you want to stop using the plugin. A lot of
  these changes will usually reside in the `unstable` branch and will only get periodically merged
  into main so you don't freak out knowing that every update might have broken something.

  An important thing to note is that if you're just a regular user of Neorg you probably won't come
  face-to-face with these issues; the tinkerers though, they will probably feel it. Here's a
  comprehensive list:

 ** Icons
    Icons have changed. Rather than using regex they are now fully parsed with TreeSitter queries
    for efficiency. This also means that the format for defining an icon has changed too:
    @code lua
    level_1 = {
        enabled = true, -- Whether or not the icon is enabled
        icon = "•", -- The actual icon itself
        highlight = "NeorgUnorderedList1", -- The highlight to use on the icon
        -- The query that determines where to place the icon
        query = "(unordered_list1_prefix) @icon", -- @icon tells treesitter which node to iconify
    },
    @end
    Due to this *icons now need padding* around them if you want to conceal several chars. For
    example if you want to conceal a second-level heading (`**`) you /need/ to make your icon
    something along the lines of ` •` where as you can see there is a space before the icon itself.
    This will then overlap the first `*` with the space (therefore rendering it invisible) and will
    overlap the second `*` with your actual icon.

 ** Changes to `:Neorg set-mode`
    We've changed the command `set-mode` to just `mode` to be consistent with other commands.
    Now you can run `:Neorg mode <mode-name>` to switch to your desired mode. This also means
    you should *update your keybinds* if you've defined any custom ones.

    Btw you can also now run `:Neorg mode` without any arguments to get the current mode printed out
    in `:messages`, pretty neat eh?

 ** New Defintion syntax
    After a discussion of the new link syntax (coming soon!) we decided to change the syntax for
    /definitions/ from using the detached modifier `:` to `$`, instead:
  *** Old
      @code norg
      : Object to be defined
      Actual definition text

      :: Multi-paragraph version
      Text can go here

      on multiple paragraphs.
      ::
      @end

  *** New
      @code norg
      $ Object to be defined
      Actual definition text

      $$ Multi-paragraph version
      Text can go here

      on multiple paragraphs.
      $$
      @end

 ** New Carryover-Tag syntax
    To differentiate carryover tags from the new definitions (see above) we also changed these from
    using `$` to `#`:
  *** Old
      @code norg
      $comment
      This is a comment.

      $color #ff0000
      $ New-style definition
      You see this would not look very nice.
      @end

  *** New
      @code norg
      #comment
      This is a comment.

      #color #ff0000
      $ New-style definition
      This is considerably better.
      @end

 ** Ranged Tags
    With the new version of the TS parser ranged tags are now no longer "indent strict", and the
    beginning of the tag can be placed at a different indentation level than the `@end` of that tag.

 ** Inline Comments
    Since carryover tags now utilise the `#` symbol we needed to change the syntax for inline
    comments to avoid ambiguity. To do this `#inline comments like this#` have now been changed to
    `+inline comment like this+`. We believe the symbol makes sense - it's like adding something
    extra inbetween your text! Just for clarification:
  *** Old
      @code norg
      This is some text
      #a comment inbetween#
      and some text below.
      @end

  *** New
      @code norg
      This is some text
      +a comment inbetween+
      and some text below.
      @end
