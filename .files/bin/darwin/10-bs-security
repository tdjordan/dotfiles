# This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
# because some formulae require a newer version of libffi.
#
# For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
#     LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib

# - brew install gnupg
# Once you run this version of gpg you may find it difficult to return to using
# a prior 1.4.x or 2.0.x. Most notably the prior versions will not automatically
# know about new secret keys created or imported by this version. We recommend
# creating a backup of your `~/.gnupg` prior to first use.
