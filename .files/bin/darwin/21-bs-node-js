# icu4c is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
# because macOS provides libicucore.dylib (but nothing else).
#
# If you need to have icu4c first in your PATH run:
#   echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
#   echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
#
# For compilers to find icu4c you may need to set:
#   export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib"
#   export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/icu4c/include"

brew install node
