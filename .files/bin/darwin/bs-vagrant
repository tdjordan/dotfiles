# A CA file has been bootstrapped using certificates from the SystemRoots
# keychain. To add additional certificates (e.g. the certificates added in
# the System keychain), place .pem files in
#   /usr/local/etc/openssl/certs
#
# and run
#   /usr/local/opt/openssl/bin/c_rehash
#
# This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
# because Apple has deprecated use of OpenSSL in favor of its own TLS and crypto libraries.
#
# If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
#   echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
#
# For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
#     LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib
#     CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include
